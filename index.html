                    <h3>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h3>
                    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, India—died April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam),
                        Indian mathematician whose contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries
                        of the properties of the partition function.

                        When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s Synopsis of Elementary
                        Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, 2 vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of
                        theorems, many presented with only the briefest of proofs and with no material newer than 1860,
                        aroused his genius. Having verified the results in Carr’s book, Ramanujan went beyond it,
                        developing his own theorems and ideas. In 1903 he secured a scholarship to the University of
                        Madras but lost it the following year because he neglected all other studies in pursuit of
                        mathematics.<br><br>
                        Ramanujan continued his work, without employment and living in the poorest circumstances. After
                        marrying in 1909 he began a search for permanent employment that culminated in an interview with
                        a government official, Ramachandra Rao. Impressed by Ramanujan’s mathematical prowess, Rao
                        supported his research for a time, but Ramanujan, unwilling to exist on charity, obtained a
                        clerical post with the Madras Port Trust.
